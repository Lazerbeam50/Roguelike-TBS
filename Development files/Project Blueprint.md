**Basic story** – None that is not procedurally generated. The player will play as the owner, general manager, field commander and tactician of a mercenary company in a medieval fantasy setting. 

**Basic gameplay features**
- Turn-based rogue-like wargame – The main gameplay will revolve around controlling your army to defeat the opponent's army and complete your objectives. Your army will consist of different unit types which will vary in their strengths and weaknesses.
- Financial management – Units in the player's army have structured contracts which will need to be renewed over time. Units negotiate with the player to put together a contract which contains a mix of up front payments, weekly/monthly payments, cuts of the profit, and payment by results (by the kill/level up/successful mission). The player must keep money flowing into the company by completing jobs, pillaging or treasure hunting, as failing to pay units will cause them to become unhappy, refuse to work, organise strikes, and eventually leave.
- Army management – The player will need to keep the army stocked up on weapons, items and set up training sessions to help units gain exp outside of missions. More independently of the player, units will form friendship and support groups which give bonuses when they fight in close proximity to their friends. Units will also have personality traits which determine who they get on with (if anyone), how they behave in some events, and how they behave in negotiations with the player.
- World generation – The world will be randomly generated at the start of a new game, with noble houses, kingdoms, towns, mercenary groups and other key factions randomly set up. These factions will vary in their favourability towards the player's company, their relationships with other factions, their military might and goals.
- Jobs – The main typical source of income into the company is through completing mercenary jobs. The factions and NPCs will approach the player's company with job offers leading to one or more battles in exchange for gold. Refusing or failing a job can result in the NPC/faction's attitude towards the company going down.
- Travelling – The player can send groups of units away from their mercenary stronghold to complete jobs, explore areas and visit towns (for shopping, to find work etc.). Events are rolled for both the travelling groups and the units at the stronghold, meaning that the player will have to alternate between controlling multiple groups.
- Rogue-like features – All unit deaths, contract confirmations, job completions/failures and similar actions are permanent. Additionally, should the player get a game over from going bankrupt, having all of their units die, or having their stronghold sacked, the save will be invalidated.
- Events – Random events relating to factions/NPCs approaching the player with jobs, player units getting into arguments and being attacked whilst travelling occur over time.

**Target groups** – Myself and friends but I will share the game with anyone else who is interested.

**Basic Technical specs** – The game will be written in Python 3.6 through Pycharm, using Pygame 2.0 for graphics, sound and input. Cython will be used for pathfinding. Numpy/Pandas will be used for statistics. Aesprite will be used for sprite creation and editing. Pyinstaller be used to export the code into an executable.

**Estimations** – Project should remain open source with no spending on assets.

**Core goals** – Build my own turn-based rogue-like with:

- Fire Emblem-style combat, with new classes, mechanics and enemy types.
- Create a Fire Emblem-style rogue-like game, which random use of maps, objectives and challenges.
